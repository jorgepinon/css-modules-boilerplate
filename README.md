# CSS Modules using React

This is my own boilerplate/test code for CSS Modules, using React in this case.

To see it in action, clone the repo, install dependencies:

```npm install```

and run the webpack build:

```webpack```

This project is inspired by Mark Dalgleish's post, [A Unified Styling Language](https://medium.com/seek-blog/a-unified-styling-language-d0c208de2660) and [css-modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) on Github.

The first post that convinced me that CSS-in-JS is worth looking into.
